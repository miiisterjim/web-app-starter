After each step, commit your changes with a commit message of `Exercise X` where `X` is the exercise number

1. Fix the broken test
2. Use a console.log statement to print the value of the response before it is returned to the browser (in the API)
3. Use a debug breakpoint to inspect the value of the response before it is sent back to the browser, and alter/edit the value that is returned
4. Use a console.log statement to print the value of the response in the browser console before it is displayed to the user
5. Use a debug breakpoint in the browser to inspect the value of the response before it is displayed to the user
6. Update the API so that it accepts a Query String value and returns "Hello {value}!" e.g. Hello Owen! If no Query String value is set then continue to return "Hello World!". Make sure we have tests to confirm it's working as we expect
7. Update the frontend to take the user entered value and pass that to the API and render the response
